# 7.1.5 ToInt32 ( argument )

The abstract operation ToInt32 converts argument to one of 2<sup>32</sup> integer values in the range -2<sup>31</sup> through 2<sup>31</sup>-1, inclusive. This abstract operation functions as follows:

- Let number be ? ToNumber(argument).
- If number is NaN, +0, -0, +∞, or -∞, return +0.
- Let int be the mathematical value that is the same sign as number and whose magnitude is floor(abs(number)).
- Let int32bit be int modulo 2<sup>32</sup>.
- If int32bit ≥ 2<sup>31</sup>, return int32bit - 2<sup>32</sup>; otherwise return int32bit.

> **NOTE**
> Given the above definition of ToInt32:
>
> - The ToInt32 abstract operation is idempotent: if applied to a result that it produced, the second application leaves that value unchanged.
> - ToInt32(ToUint32(x)) is equal to ToInt32(x) for all values of x. (It is to preserve this latter property that +∞ and -∞ are mapped to +0.)
> - ToInt32 maps -0 to +0.

This section contains a non-normative overview of the ECMAScript language.

此章节包含 ECMAScript 语法的一个非标准的概述。

ECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing computations and manipulating computational objects within a host environment. ECMAScript as defined here is not intended to be computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results. Instead, it is expected that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and other facilities described in this specification but also certain environment-specific objects, whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of this specification except to indicate that they may provide certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can be called from an ECMAScript program.

ECMAScript 是一个面向对象编程语言，在宿主环境中执行计算和操作计算对象。这里定义的 ECMAScript 不打算在计算上是自给自足的；事实上，在本说明书中没有规定用于输入外部数据或输出计算结果。事实上，期望 ECMAScript 程序计算环境能不仅提供对象和其他规范中描述的能力，还有某些环境指定的对象，即其描述和行为超出了本说明书的范围，只是指出它们可以提供某些可以访问的属性和可以从 ECMAScript 程序调用的某些功能。

ECMAScript was originally designed to be used as a scripting language, but has become widely used as a general-purpose programming language. A scripting language is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system. In such systems, useful functionality is already available through a user interface, and the scripting language is a mechanism for exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the existing system is said to provide a host environment of objects and facilities, which completes the capabilities of the scripting language. A scripting language is intended for use by both professional and non-professional programmers.

ECMAScript 最初被设计为脚本语言，但已被广泛地用作通用编程语言。脚本语言是一种编程语言，用于操纵、定制和自动化现有系统的设备。在这样的系统中，有用的功能已经通过用户接口获得，并且脚本语言是用于将该功能暴露给程序控制的机制。以这种方式，现有的系统被称为提供对象和设施的主机环境，从而完成脚本语言的能力。脚本语言旨在供专业人员和非专业程序员使用。

ECMAScript was originally designed to be a Web scripting language, providing a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture. ECMAScript is now used to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of host environments. Therefore the core language is specified in this document apart from any particular host environment.

ECMAScript 最初被设计成一种 Web 脚本语言，提供了一种在浏览器中激活网页的机制，并作为基于 Web 的客户端-服务器体系结构的一部分来执行服务器计算。ECMAScript 现在用于为各种主机环境提供核心脚本能力。因此，除了任何特定的主机环境之外，在本文档中指定核心语言。

ECMAScript usage has moved beyond simple scripting and it is now used for the full spectrum of programming tasks in many different environments and scales. As the usage of ECMAScript has expanded, so has the features and facilities it provides. ECMAScript is now a fully featured general-purpose programming language.

ECMAScript 的使用已经超越了简单的脚本，现在它被用于各种不同环境和尺度的编程任务的全方位。随着 ECMAScript 的使用扩展，它提供的特性和设施也在扩展。ECMAScript 现在是一个功能齐全的通用编程语言。

Some of the facilities of ECMAScript are similar to those used in other programming languages; in particular C, Java™, Self, and Scheme as described in:

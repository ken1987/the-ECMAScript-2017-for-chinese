# 介绍

This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2017 Language. It is the eighth edition of the ECMAScript Language Specification. Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most widely used general-purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.

Ecma 标准定义了语言 ECMAScript 2017。它是 ECMAScript 语言规范第八版。自从 1997 年发布第一版，ECMAScript 已经发展成为世界上最广泛使用的通用编程语言之一。它不仅是网页浏览器中最为知名的嵌入式语言，也被广泛的应用于服务端和嵌入式应用。

ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.

ECMAScript 源于多种技术，最为知名的是 JavaScript (网景) 和 JScript (微软)。这门语言是 Brendan Eich 在网景时发明的，并且第一次应用于那家公司的 Navigator 2.0 浏览器上。它还被应用于网景的随后的所有浏览器中，以及微软的 Internet Explorer 3.0 开始的所有浏览器中。

The development of the ECMAScript Language Specification started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.

在 1996 年 11 月，ECMAScript 语言规范开始开发。1997 年 6 月，Ecma 标准第一版在 Ecma 大会上被采纳。

That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature.

1998 年 4 月，Ecma 标准被提交给 ISO/IEC JTC 1，通过“快车道”程序被采纳，并且核准作为国际标准 ISO/IEC 16262。1998 年 6 月，Ecma 大会采纳了 ECMA-262 第二版，使它与 ISO/IEC 16262 一致。实际上，第一版和第二版只是编辑上的不同。

The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.

第三版标准引进了强大的正则表达式、更好的字符串处理、新的控制域、try/catch 异常处理、严禁的错误定义、数值输出格式，并且预测了语言未来发展中的一些变化。1999 年 12 月，第三版标准被 Ecma 大会采纳；2002 年 6 月作为 ISO/IEC 16262:2002 发布。

After publication of the third edition, ECMAScript achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. However, that work was not completed and not published as the fourth edition of ECMAScript but some of it was incorporated into the development of the sixth edition.

第三版发布后，EcMAScript 与万维网结合得到了广泛采用，它已成为几乎所有 Web 浏览器支持的编程语言。开发 ECMAScript 第四版便成了一项重要的工作。但是，这项工作最终未能完成和发布 ECMAScript 第四版，而一些（特性或提案）被合并到第六版的开发中。

The fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5th edition) codified de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations and added support for new features that had emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security. The fifth edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 2009.

ECMAScript 第五版（作为 ECMA-262 第五版发布）将关于这门语言规范的既有事实的解释进行整理，即已经成为常见浏览器的实现和已添加支持的第三版发布后的新特性。这些特性包括：访问器属性、创建反射、对象检查、program control of property attributes、补充的数组处理函数、支持 JSON 对象格式化编码、提供更强的错误检查和程序安全的严格模式。2009 年 11 月，第五版被 Ecma 大会采纳。

The fifth edition was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262:2011. Edition 5.1 of the ECMAScript Standard incorporated minor corrections and is the same text as ISO/IEC 16262:2011. The 5.1 Edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 2011.

第五版被提交给 ISO/IEC JTC 1 ，通过“快车道”程序被采纳，并且核准作为国际标准 ISO/IEC 16262:2011。
ECMAScript 标准 5.1 版本包含小的改动，并和 ISO/IEC 16262:2011 一样的版本。2011 年 6 月，5.1 版本被 Ecma 大会采纳。

Focused development of the sixth edition started in 2009, as the fifth edition was being prepared for publication. However, this was preceded by significant experimentation and language enhancement design efforts dating to the publication of the third edition in 1999. In a very real sense, the completion of the sixth edition is the culmination of a fifteen year effort. The goals for this addition included providing better support for large applications, library creation, and for use of ECMAScript as a compilation target for other languages.Some of its major enhancements included modules, class declarations, lexical block scoping, iterators and generators, promises for asynchronous programming, destructuring patterns, and proper tail calls. The ECMAScript library of built-ins was expanded to support additional data abstractions including maps, sets, and arrays of binary numeric values as well as additional support for Unicode supplemental characters in strings and regular expressions.The built-ins were also made extensible via subclassing. The sixth edition provides the foundation for regular, incremental language and library enhancements. The sixth edition was adopted by the General Assembly of June 2015.

在 2009 年，第六版的开发开始了，像第五版准备发布一样受到关注。但是，这重要的实验和语言增强设计的努力可以追溯到 1999 年第三版发布。确切的说，第六版的完成是十五年努力的结果。附加的目标包括：为大型应用提供更好的支持、类库的创建，以及用 ECMAScript 作为其他语言的编译目标。一些主要的增加包括：模块、类的声明、词法块作用域、迭代器、生成器、提供异步编程的 promises、解构模式、尾调用。ECMAScript 内置库扩展支持额外的数据抽象，包括：maps, sets 和二进制数值数组、在字符串和正则表达式中额外支持 Unicode supplemental characters。内置库可以通过子类扩展。第六版提供基础的正则、增量语言和库增强。2015 年 6 月，第六版被大会采纳。

ECMAScript 2016 was the first ECMAScript edition released under Ecma TC39's new yearly release cadence and open development process. A plain-text source document was built from the ECMAScript 2015 source document to serve as the base for further development entirely on GitHub. Over the year of this standard's development, hundreds of pull requests and issues were filed representing thousands of bug fixes, editorial fixes and other improvements. Additionally, numerous software tools were developed to aid in this effort including Ecmarkup, Ecmarkdown, and Grammarkdown. ES2016 also included support for a new exponentiation operator and adds a new method to Array.prototype called includes.

ECMAScript 2016 是在 ECMA TC39 新的逐年发布的节奏和开放开发进程下发布的第一个 ECMAScript 版本。从 ECMAScript 2015 源文件作为一个纯文本源文件建立在 GitHub。标准开发的过去的一年，数以百计的 pull requests 和 issues 提出，数以千计的 bug 修复、编辑修复、其他的改进。此外，开发了许多软件工具来帮助这项工作，包括 ECRAMUP、ECRMARDUN 和 GRAMBASKDOWN。ES2016 还包括支持一个新的幂运算符、为 array.prototype 新增一个新的方法 includes。

This specification introduces Async Functions, Shared Memory, and Atomics along with smaller language and library enhancements, bug fixes, and editorial updates. Async functions improve the asynchronous programming experience by providing syntax for promise-returning functions. Shared Memory and Atomics introduce a new memory model that allows multi-agent programs to communicate using atomic operations that ensure a well-defined execution order even on parallel CPUs. This specification also includes new static methods on Object: Object.values, Object.entries, and Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors.

此规范介绍了异步函数、共享内存、较小的语言的原子学、库增强、错误修复和编辑更新。异步函数通过提供 promise-returning 函数从而提升异步编程体验。共享内存和原子学介绍一个新的内存模型，即允许 multi-agent 程序使用原子操作进行通信，确保即使在并行 CPU 上也有明确定义的执行顺序。此规范也包括新的对象静态方法 bject.values、Object.entries、 Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors。

Dozens of individuals representing many organizations have made very significant contributions within Ecma TC39 to the development of this edition and to the prior editions. In addition, a vibrant community has emerged supporting TC39's ECMAScript efforts. This community has reviewed numerous drafts, filed thousands of bug reports, performed implementation experiments, contributed test suites, and educated the world-wide developer community about ECMAScript. Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify and acknowledge every person and organization who has contributed to this effort.

几十个代表许多组织的人在 ECMA TC39 中对这一版本的发展作出了非常重要的贡献。此外，一个充满活力的社区已经出现，支持 TC39 开发 ECMAScript 的工作而努力。这个社区已经审查了许多草案，提交了数以千计的 bug 报告，进行了实施实验，贡献了测试套件，并向全世界的开发者社区普及 ECMAScript。不幸的是，不可能确认和鸣谢为此努力做出贡献的每个人和组织。
